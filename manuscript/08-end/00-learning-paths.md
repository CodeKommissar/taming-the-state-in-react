# Last but not Least

Well, if I haven't lost you by now, you can read a bit further to make it to the end of this book. You will learn about further learning paths after you have read the book, a life hack to improve your learning experience and other people in the (React and) Redux ecosystem that you might want to follow.

## Further Learning Paths

The book uses React as its view layer. But React is not mandatory to utilize Redux or MobX. Other view layer libraries or even SPA frameworks have their own local state management. Yet they can be used together with Redux or MobX. You can substitue the React view layer with your own solution to build modern applications. If you haven't read [the Road to learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/) and this book made a good job pitching React to you, you can give it a shot. It teaches the fundamentals of plain React by building an larger application that consumes an external REST API.

- you have build a few applications in this book. do you have furhter ideas how to extends these feature wise? or do you think any technical aspect that is covered in this book is not applied to these applications? challenge yourself and try to apply these aspects. the ecosystem around (React and) Redux is huge. Surely the book didn't cover everything, but only the core of the most important aspect.

- apis (ref) + own application

- tipps to learn react and redux (ref)
- you can build like a SoundCloud Client in React and Redux. Or you take another REST API and build a Reddit, Twitter or Yelp application.

- aother challenge would be to build redux from scratch on your own. the library is fairly small and covered in multiple tutorials that you can find online to replicate it. it internalizes your learnings about the library yet gives you a hands on experience to build your own state management solution

- if you want to go beyond and try out graphQL and relay modern, search for platforms that expose a GraphQL API
- when you serach for those, you will probably stumble on tutorials to consume these GraphQL APIs
- https://t.co/6shh5JPPVB?ssr=true graphql and cosmic js
