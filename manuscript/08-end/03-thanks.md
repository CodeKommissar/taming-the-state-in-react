## Thank You

- thank you for reading the book or taking the full blown course
- i am hopeful that it helped you to understand the broader topic of state management in modern applications yet also gave you a hands on experience when using the tools

- recommend the book to someone who is learning React yet also other frontend frameworks and libraries like vue and angular, state management is an important topic and frontend developers need to align on this to get on the next level of applications
