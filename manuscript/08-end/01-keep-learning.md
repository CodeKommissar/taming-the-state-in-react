## Never stop Learning

- one of the great secrets when writing about software development is that you learn yourself tons of stuff
- you elarn about the little nuances and you dive deep into topics because you want to teach them the right way
- i can only recommend you to teach yourself
- pick one of your friends or peers who wants to learn about state management in react or another frontend framework/library and apply your learnings from this book to teach, after all you can stil take the book as guidance, but you will internalize your learnings when you teach someone else
- another great opportunity to teach others in this topic will be the slack channel for this book where you can help out others
