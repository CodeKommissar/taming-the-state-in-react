## Never stop Learning

I believe there is one secret when it comes to learning. There exists a principle that is called the Learning Pyramid. When you search for it in your favorite search engine, you will definitely find it. Basically it shows the relation between retention rates and mental activities For instance, the average student retention when doing lectures is 5%. That's not a good rate at all. Let's see how all the other mental activities break down according to their retention rates:

* **5% Lecture**
* **10% Reading** (Uuups!)
* **20% Audiovisual** (Phew...) TODO check if doing screencasts
* **30% Demonstration** (Check!)
* **50% Discussion** (Did I mention that there is a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/)?)
* **75% Practice by Doing** (I hope your did all hands on chapters!)
* **90% Teach Others** (You can help others in the [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/))

Perhaps you recall it from somewhere, but it is always refreshing to see it again. In the beginning of the book, I have written down some words that say that nobody learned something by reading a book. You have to apply your learnings. I hope that I arranged the book in a way, enabling you with all the techniques and exercises along the way, that you can learn form these experiences. In addition, I gave you in the last chapter some more learning paths to practice by doing.

Finally let's get to the one secret about learning that I mentioned. It is the bottom item in the pyramid that has the biggest return of investment: Teaching Others. Personally I made the same experience when I started to blog about my experiences in web development, answered questions on Quora, Reddit and Stack Overflow, and wrote a book(s). You have to dive deep into a topic in order to teach it to others. you learn about the little nuances and you dive deep into topics because you want to teach them the right way. It's no shallow learning experience, because you get to know every detail in order to explain it precisely. You will learn tons of stuff that you didn't know before. And most important you will internalize these things by teaching it to others.

After all, you can't know everything. No one is an expert. I am no expert but I challenge myself too by trying to teach things. I get great feedback from people, positive and negative, that I can apply to grow myself. You can do it as well. You can become better by challenging yourself, teach something to others and grow yourself.

So here is my quest for you after you have read this book. I am sure that you have a friend, coworker or perhaps a virtual person, from Stack Overflow or Reddit, who is keen to learn about state management in modern applications. Schedule a get-together with this person and teach him/her state management in modern applications (when using React). You can take this book as guidance. After all, teaching others is a win-win situation. Both participants, mentor and student, will grow themselves. So my advice for you: Become a mentor, teach others and grow yourself.
