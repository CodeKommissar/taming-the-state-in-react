# Local State Management

This chapter will guide you through state management in React without taking any external state management library into account. You will revisit state management in React with only `this.setState()` and `this.state`. It enables you already to build large applications without complicating and overengineering it. Not every application needs external state management in the first place.

By revisiting the topic of local state management in React, you will get to know how to use the local state in a React application. The chapter guides you through important topics when dealing with state in React: controlled components, unidirectional data flow and asynchronous state. It will teach you all these neccessary topics before diving into state managament with an external state management library.

After revisiting the local state, you will get to know best practices and patterns to scale your state management when using local state. Even though you are not dependent on external state management solutions yet, you can use a handful of those techniques to scale state management with external libraries too.

At the end of the chapter, you will get to know the limits of local state management in React. The topic itself is highly discussed in the community as you will learn in one of the final lessons of this chapter. The chapter concludes in the problem of local state managenement to give you a motivation to dive into one of the external state management solutions.
