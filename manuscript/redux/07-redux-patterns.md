## Command vs. Event Pattern

- single vs multiple reducers
- to close to command should be evaluated as local state
- Action to Reducer like 1:N

Last but not least, I want to give you clarification on the relationship between actions and reducers. You know that your application can have multiple actions and reducers. But how do they relate to each other?


- showcase one action that is captured by multiple reducers
- that will be explained in greater detail in the Command and Event patterns in Redux

## State Keys

- makes more sense when command pattern

## Folder Organization

- technical, feature
- top level when event pattern, feature level when command pattern
### Ducks?
