## How to read the Book

- make sure to understand each lesson before you continue to the next lesson, the book is written in a way that the learnings build up on each other
- your knowledge base will not only scale horizontally but also vertically
- that's why it is important to internalize each learning
- apply them in an own application
- i try to give exercsises and read mores to enhance your learnigns (TODO check if I do it for real)

- hands on chapters that build up on each other, (can be found as video course, if you have bought the big package)
- please make notes while you read the book to give me feedback afterward about the good and the bad parts. I am highly interested ti improve the book continously

- explain roten pfaden durch bucg
- React is foundation, but could be exchange by other libraries, frameworks

- Hands On should be tried yourself when the task is clear, otherwise it will guide you through the implementation

- hands on will often apply in a JS bin. the JS bin is simple and doesn't handle all JavaScript features. it uses Babel that enabkes you to use JavaScript ES6 features, but features beyond that are missing

- exercises can be done by yourself, as challenges as well, but there is no solution provided. only information how you could solve it
