## About the Author

Robin Wieruch is a german software engineer who is dedicated to learn and teach programming in JavaScript. After he graduated from university with a masters degree in computer science, he didn't stop to learn. His experiences from the start up world, where he used JavaScript excessivley during his professional time and spare time, gave him the opportunity to teach others about these topics.

For a long time Robin worked at a startup called Small Improvements in Berlin. The company builds a SaaS product enabling companies to create a feedback culture. By giving continously feedback, following short-term and long-term objectives, the company enables individuals and companies to grow. Robin worked closely with a great team of engineers who are all keen to learn and to grow.

During his time at the startup, Robin wrote regularly articles about web development and self-improvement on his website (TODO link). After a while, he noticed that people seemed to like it. Article after article Robin grow in his ability to teach others. Whereas the first tutorial was packed with stuff to learn, which could be quite overwhelming for the students, the articles improved over time by teaching only one subject at a time. In addition, by reading a lot of books, Robin enhanced his abilities in writing (TODO wirign well) and other techniques (TODO FLOW, Deep Work).
