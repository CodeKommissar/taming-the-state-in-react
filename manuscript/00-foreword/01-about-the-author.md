## About the Author

Robin Wieruch is a german software and web engineer who is dedicated to learn and teach programming in JavaScript. After he graduated from university with a masters degree in computer science, he didn't stop to learn. His experiences from the startup world, where he used JavaScript excessivley during his professional time and spare time, gave him the opportunity to teach others about topics in sofware and web development.

For a few years, Robin worked closely with a great team of engineers at a startup called [Small Improvements](https://www.small-improvements.com/) on a large scale application. The company builds a SaaS product enabling customers to create a feedback culture at their company. Small Improvements belives that an alignement of objectives and short feedback loops are enabler for individuals and companies to thrive. By giving continously feedback, following short-term and long-term objectives, that are desired by individuals and the company, Small Improvements enables companies to grow by having a feedback culture.

During his time at the startup, Robin wrote regularly articles about web development and self-improvement on his [website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/). He noticed that people would give him great feedback on his articles that allowed him to improve his writing and teaching style. Article after article Robin grew in his ability to teach others. Whereas the first article was packed with too much stuff to learn, which could be quite overwhelming for students, the articles improved over time by focusing and teaching only one subject.

Now Robin is self-emplyoed to teach others. He finds it a fulfilling activity to see students thrive by giving them clear objectives and a short feedback loop. But without coding himself he couldn't teach things. That's why he invests his remaining time in programming himself.
