# How to read the Book

- make sure to understand each lesson before you continue to the next lesson, the book is written in a way that the learnings build up on each other
- your knowledge base will not only scale horizontally but also vertically
- that's why it is important to internalize each learning
- apply them in an own application
- i try to give exercsises and read mores to enhance your learnigns (TODO check if I do it for real)
