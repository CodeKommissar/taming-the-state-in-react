# Requirements

What previous knowledge do you need to bring? First of all, you should be familiar with the basics of web development. You should know how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The book uses React as library to teach modern state management. React is a perfect use case to demonstrate and learn state managament. Because React is only a view layer, it is up to us to choose how to deal with the state in our application. That makes the solution of state management exchangeable. After all, you should know how to write an application with only React.

If you are not familiar with React or need to have a refresher on the topic, I can recommend you to read the precedent book: The Road to learn React. It is pay what you want. It should enable everyone to learn React. But you can decide to pay if you can afford it.

The book the Road to learn React [supports education in the developing world](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). People with lacking education have no access to open source in the first place. They have to be educated in the English language to get access to it. Even though the book is pay what you want, it supports projects to educate children occasionally.

In addition, the Road to learn React teaches you to make the transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. After reading the book you should have all the knowledge to read this book. It builds perfectly up on the React book.

What about the development environment? You will need a running editor (IDE) and terminal (command line tool). You can [follow my setup guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/). It is adjusted for Mac users, but you can substitute most of the tools for other operating system. There are a ton of articles out there that will show you to setup a web development environment if you want to follow another guide.

Last but not least you will need an installation of [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). Both are used to manage libraries you will need along the way to learn React. You will install external node packages via npm (node package manager). These node packages can be libraries or whole frameworks.

You can verify your versions of node and npm on the command line. If you don't get any output in the terminal, you need to install node and npm first. These are my versions:

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
node --version
*v7.4.0
npm --version
*v4.0.5
~~~~~~~~

When you read the Road to learn React, you should be familiar with the setup already. The book gives you also a short introduction into the npm ecosystem on the command line.
